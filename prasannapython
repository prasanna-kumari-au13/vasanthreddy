1.Write down all the operators in python covered in class.And A brief description  about them?
Ans:     Python language supports the following types of operators.
 
               *Arithmetic Operators.
               *Comparison (Relational) Operators.
               *Assignment Operators.
               *Logical Operators.
 ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:

              + Addition:	     
                     Adds values on either side of the operator.	
                                a + b
            - Subtraction:
                    Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.
	                a â€“ b 
              *Multiplication:
                    Multiplies values on either side of the operator.
                                   a * b
             / Division:	
                    Divides right hand operand by left hand operand.	
                                 a/b
              % Modulus:
               	     Divides right hand operand by left hand operand and returns remainder.
	               a%b
             ** Exponent	:
                      Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators.
	                 a**b
  COMPARISION OPERATORS:
               These operators compare the values on either sides of them and decide the relation among them. They are also called Relational operators.

          ==	 If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.	
                      (a == b) 
          !=	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	
                    (a != b) 
          <>	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	
                     (a <> b) 
           >	If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
                     (a > b) 
          <	If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	
                     (a < b) 
         >=	If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	
                     (a >= b) 
         <=	If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	
                     (a <= b) 
ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS:
                 
            =	Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand.
	c = a + b assigns value of a + b into c
         += 	It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand.
	c += a is equivalent to c = c + a
          -= 	It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand.	
                 c -= a is equivalent to c = c - a
          *=	It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand
	c *= a is equivalent to c = c * a
           /= 	It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand.
	c /= a is equivalent to c = c / a
          %=	It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand.
	c %= a is equivalent to c = c % a
         **= 	Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand.
	c **= a is equivalent to c = c ** a
          //=	It performs floor division on operators and assign value to the left operand.
                 c //= a is equivalent to c = c // a
LOGICAL OPERATORS:

   and Logical AND:	If both the operands are true then condition becomes true.
	                     (a and b) 
    or Logical OR:	If any of the two operands are non-zero then condition becomes true.
	                      (a or b) 
    not Logical NOT:	Used to reverse the logical state of its operand.	
                                      not(a and b)
